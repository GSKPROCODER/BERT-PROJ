# Notes:
# - Railway can detect services from a Dockerfile or docker-compose. This file
#   avoids mounting local source (suitable for CI/CD and Railway deploys).
# - If you prefer Railway to build only a single service, set the appropriate
#   `build` and `service` in the Railway project settings.
