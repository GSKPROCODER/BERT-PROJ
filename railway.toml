# Railway Configuration
# This file provides default Railway deployment settings
# See: https://docs.railway.com/reference/config-as-code

# Note: For multi-service deployments, Railway will auto-detect Dockerfiles
# in each service directory. This file provides defaults but each service
# can be configured individually in the Railway dashboard.

# Default build configuration (Railway will auto-detect Dockerfile)
