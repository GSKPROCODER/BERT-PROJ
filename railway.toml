# Railway Configuration
# This file provides default Railway deployment settings
# See: https://docs.railway.com/reference/config-as-code
#
# Note: For multi-service deployments, Railway will auto-detect Dockerfiles
# in each service directory (backend/Dockerfile and frontend/Dockerfile).
# A root Dockerfile is also provided as a fallback for monorepo deployments.
# Each service can be configured individually in the Railway dashboard.

# Default build configuration (Railway will auto-detect Dockerfile)
[build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
# Railway will use service-specific Dockerfiles when root directory is set
# Root Dockerfile is available as fallback

# Default deploy configuration
